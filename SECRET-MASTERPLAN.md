# Vision:

We believe that we are living one of the most important technological revolutions in human history. We want to be a part of it. 

In our opinion it is still very early to decide which direction to take and to commit to for the next 20 years. So we have decided to create an AI Automation Studio where we can test, deploy and iterate different AI solutions, either services software or hardware. 

We see two potential paths that Aztlan AI can take in the future: 
	1. To continue the AI studio model and to have a portfolio of products and services. 
	2. If we see or find a fuck yes product idea, we go all in and turn Aztlan AI into a startup. 

We are born in Mexico City but have a global mindset since day one. Not only do we want to be the best in Mexico but we want to compete worldwide (USA, Dubai, Brazil, Singapore, China, etc).

We believe in open source and building in public, so we have decided to share our journey, being as transparent as possible, both with strategy and technology. 

# 10 year goals:

- [ ] $100M ARR
- [ ] International presence
- [ ] Being a household name in AI

# How we are going to do it:

We are going to start in Mexico, which is where we currently are, but we are already exploring international opportunities and we will slowly make the transition to new markets. 

We have three main pillars that we are going to follow in order to get clients, credibility and of course, money. 
1. *Content*: sharing our journey, our learnings, our fuck ups, our opinions, our development processes, as well as educating the market about AI and its potential. 
2. *Technology Tinkering*: We want to be at the forefront of technology and in order to accomplish this we have to be constantly innovating and using and testing the latest AI developments. This will allow us to provide our clients with the best solutions. 
3. *Networking*: We believe genuine networking is underrated and sometimes negatively associated, but it's all about people, and if you want to build something transformational you need a tribe of like-minded individuals.

We identify ourselves as a startup in the sense of moving fast, breaking things and innovating. But we have a very long term view and know that you need time in order to build something great. 

We are not looking to make an exit as a unicorn in the next 7 years. We are playing the infinite game with Aztlan AI, which means, focusing on profitability and building something we are willing to work on for the rest of our lives. 

As Elon would say, don't tell anyone ;)

Abrazos, 
Mau and Arnaud
